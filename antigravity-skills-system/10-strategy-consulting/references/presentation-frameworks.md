# Presentation Frameworks Reference

## Additional Narrative Structures

### Problem-Agitate-Solve (PAS)

Best for: Sales presentations, product pitches

```
1. PROBLEM
   "Teams waste 10 hours/week in status meetings"

2. AGITATE
   "That's $50K/year per engineer in lost productivity.
    And it's getting worse as teams grow."

3. SOLVE
   "Async updates reduce meeting time by 80%.
    Here's how it works..."
```

### STAR Method

Best for: Case studies, success stories

```
SITUATION
"Client X had a 40% cart abandonment rate"

TASK
"Reduce abandonment to under 20%"

ACTION
"Implemented one-click checkout and retargeting"

RESULT
"Abandonment dropped to 15%, revenue up $2M"
```

### Minto Pyramid

Best for: Complex analytical presentations

```
        ┌─────────────────┐
        │  MAIN MESSAGE   │
        │  (Answer first) │
        └────────┬────────┘
                 │
    ┌────────────┼────────────┐
    │            │            │
┌───┴───┐   ┌───┴───┐   ┌───┴───┐

- Headcount: 10 → 30 → 60
```

## Appendix Strategies

### Backup Slides

Prepare for tough questions:

```
BACKUP SLIDES TO HAVE READY:
├── Detailed financials (monthly breakdown)
├── Technical architecture
├── Competitive deep dive
├── Customer research methodology
├── Team bios
├── Implementation timeline detail
├── Risk mitigation plans
└── Reference customers
```

### Handling Q&A

```
QUESTION PATTERNS:

"How did you calculate X?"
→ Go to methodology backup slide

"What about competitor Y?"
→ Go to competitive analysis backup

"What's the worst case?"
→ Go to risk/sensitivity backup

"Who else uses this?"
→ Go to customer references backup
```

## Design Best Practices

### Color Usage

```
PRIMARY:    Use for titles, key data
SECONDARY:  Use for supporting elements
ACCENT:     Use sparingly for emphasis
NEUTRAL:    Use for body text, backgrounds

Rule: Maximum 3 colors per slide
```

### Typography

```
TITLES:     Bold, 28-32pt
SUBTITLES:  Medium, 20-24pt
BODY:       Regular, 16-18pt
CAPTIONS:   Light, 12-14pt

Rule: Maximum 2 font families
```

### Whitespace

```
MARGINS:    40-60px from edges
PADDING:    Consistent between elements
ALIGNMENT:  Grid-based, no random placement

Rule: When in doubt, add more space
```

## Delivery Tips

### Opening Strong

```
❌ "Hi, I'm going to talk about..."
✅ "We have a $10M opportunity. Here's how we capture it."

❌ "Let me start with some background..."
✅ "Three months ago, we lost our largest customer. Today, I'll show you how we won them back—and what it teaches us."
```

### Closing Strong

```
❌ "So, that's it. Any questions?"
✅ "We need a decision on X by Friday. Here's what I need from each of you..."

❌ "Thanks for your time."
✅ "The window closes in 60 days. Let's not be the company that missed it."
```

### Managing Nerves

```
BEFORE:
- Arrive early, test tech
- Review first 3 slides cold
- Take deep breaths

DURING:
- Pause, don't rush
- Make eye contact (or camera for virtual)
- It's okay to say "Good question, let me think"

AFTER:
- Send follow-up same day
- Include backup slides
- Clear next steps with owners
```
